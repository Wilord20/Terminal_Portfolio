# Terminal Portfolio
A quick project I always wanted to do. A functional Terminal that I can customize and use as a Portfolio. It was also the perfect opportunity to use all the knowledge I have been acquiring these last months.

So, you can type or click the command once it's remarked in a white color.
- **help**: Gives all the commands availables
- **echo**: Uses an argument to print the text
- **cd & ls**: They have the same function as the real ones, you can browse the files.
- **joke**: Responds with a joke using *jokeapi*
- **credits**: All the libraries I used for the project
- **clear**: The same function as the real one
